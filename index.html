                        <p>A drink that glows in the dark thanks to the quinine in tonic water, this one’s a Destiny-themed cocktail from YouTuber Cristina Viseu. Besides the tonic, you’ll need blackberry syrup for the effect, curacao and some gin. Sphere molds are nice, but you can probably get by without them.</p>

                    <h3>The Estus Flask</h3>
                    <h5>Dark Souls 1, 2, 3, & Demon Souls</h5>
                        <p>The Estus Flask, which looks like a bottle of Sunny Delight, and which is filled with fire essence from bonfires to restore your health- but since you're undead in this game maybe your unhealth? Whatever. So looking into this drink it seems there's a consensus that the drink should involve Sunny Delight- a huge mistake in my opinion. It's gross, we're not doing that. But "Cinnamon" is often associated with a kind of pleasant "heat" in food and drinks, and BarSol pisco is named for the sun, and Sunny D tastes a bit like tangerines and now I think we've got something. All I need to do now is put it together in a way that involves huge gouts of explosive flame and perfect.

                    <h3>Zelda's 2nd Potion & Water of Life</h3>
                    <h5>Legend Of Zelda</h5>
                        <p>The Original Legend of Zelda was released on February 21 1986, and since February 21 is just around the corner I'm celebrating the greatest video game series of all time with a drink. In the original game there were two potions, Water of Life and the creatively named 2nd Potion.  Water of life was blue, and 2nd Potion was red, when you consumed 2nd Potion it turned into Water of Life, thus granting a second use; a pretty good deal!  In this episode I'm imagining how one might make a 2nd Potion by turning a blue drink Red (ok, more, purplish but go with me) thus upgrading it from Water of Life into 2nd Potion.  More importantly, it's pretty tasty and I think you'll enjoy it!  At the very least your guests will be impressed.  The end result sort of reminded me of a Shirley Temple, so just for fun I make one of those too.
